        How to Speak English Confidently in Public
      </h1>
      
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 italic mb-4">
        Struggling with public speaking? This blog gives you simple techniques to overcome fear and speak English naturally in public settings.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Speaking English in public can be intimidating, especially when you're afraid of making mistakes or forgetting what to say. But the truth is, confidence is a skill â€” not a talent. With regular practice and the right techniques, you can overcome fear and become a confident speaker.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#980404] mt-8 mb-2">1. Practice Speaking Daily</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        The more you speak, the more natural it becomes. Talk to yourself in English about your day, or describe things around you. This builds fluency and trains your brain to think in English.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#980404] mt-8 mb-2">2. Use a Mirror</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Practicing in front of a mirror helps you improve body language and facial expressions. It also boosts your self-awareness and allows you to correct any awkwardness in real time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#980404] mt-8 mb-2">3. Start Small</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Donâ€™t aim to give a speech right away. Start by speaking up in small group discussions or classroom settings. Gradually increase your comfort level and move on to bigger audiences.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#980404] mt-8 mb-2">4. Think in English</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        One of the biggest challenges is translating from your native language. To fix this, train yourself to think directly in English. This makes your speaking more fluent and less hesitant.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#980404] mt-8 mb-2">5. Focus on the Message, Not Mistakes</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Most listeners donâ€™t care if you make small grammar errors â€” they care about your message. Stop worrying about perfection and focus on being clear and engaging.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#980404] mt-8 mb-2">6. Join a Speaking Club or Group</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Surrounding yourself with fellow learners can reduce fear. Language clubs, online meetings, or public speaking groups like Toastmasters help you gain real speaking practice in a friendly environment.
      </p>
